CoreRpc:

```

::: info

- You should use nginx to set PublicStorePath as static path for front end.
- Make sure AccessSecret is the same as simple-admin-core's api set
- The configuration is similar as core
- Run code the same as core
- Init database in <http://localhost:3100/init>
- Add API interface permissions on the role page, then restart the API service of file manager. You do not need to restart service after v1.0.14.
  :::

### K8s Deployment

> It is similar with core api.

You should do these step:

- deploy the images via fileapi.yaml
- modify simple-admin-backend-ui/deploy/default.conf, uncomment the file manager rule
- update ingress configmap
- update ingress controller
